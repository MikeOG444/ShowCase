## üéØ Current Focus

The ShowCase project is currently in the project setup phase. We have established the memory bank documentation and have now set up the initial project structure, including GitHub setup files, project configuration, and basic application structure for both the web and API components.

### Recent Changes

- Created and populated core memory bank files:
  - projectbrief.md: Defined the project vision, goals, and requirements
  - productContext.md: Outlined the problems being solved and product expectations
  - systemPatterns.md: Established the system architecture and design patterns
  - techContext.md: Documented technologies, development setup, and constraints
  - activeContext.md (this file): Tracking current focus and next steps
  - progress.md: Tracking project progress and status

- Set up GitHub project files:
  - .gitignore: Configured for Node.js, Python, and system files
  - README.md: Created comprehensive project overview
  - CONTRIBUTING.md: Established contribution guidelines
  - LICENSE: Added MIT license
  - GitHub templates: Added issue and PR templates
  - GitHub Actions: Set up CI workflow

- Created project structure:
  - Monorepo setup with apps/ and packages/ directories
  - Configuration files: package.json, tsconfig.json, ESLint, Prettier
  - Docker setup: docker-compose.yml and Dockerfiles for services
  - VSCode settings and recommended extensions

- Implemented basic API structure:
  - FastAPI application with sample endpoints
  - Requirements files for production and development
  - Docker configuration

- Implemented basic web application structure:
  - React/Vite setup with TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS configuration
  - Component structure with layout and pages
  - Basic routing setup

### Active Decisions

- Adopting a cross-platform approach with React Native (Expo) for mobile and React/Vite for web
- Using Firebase for authentication and analytics
- Implementing a token-based design system with Figma Tokens and Style Dictionary
- Following atomic component design principles
- Employing Zustand and React Query for state management and data fetching
- Using Docker for local development environment
- Implementing a monorepo structure for code sharing and management

## üß† Key Insights & Patterns

- The project aims to create a platform for youth athletes to track activities, earn achievements, and share their journey
- Privacy and guardian controls are essential features for the target audience
- GPS-based verified check-ins will be a core differentiator
- The system needs to support various achievement types (badges, streaks, trophies, banners)
- Social features must be designed with youth safety in mind

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Set up the initial project structure for both mobile and web platforms
2. Implement the design token system to ensure consistent styling across platforms
3. Create the authentication flow with Firebase, including guardian account linking
4. Develop the core activity logging functionality with both manual entry and GPS verification
5. Build the achievement system foundation
6. Implement basic profile and ShowCase views

## üîÑ Current Challenges

- Ensuring a consistent user experience across mobile and web platforms
- Designing a flexible activity logging system that can accommodate various sports
- Implementing robust privacy controls for minor accounts
- Creating an engaging achievement system that motivates users
