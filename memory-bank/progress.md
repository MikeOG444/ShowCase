# Progress

## What Works

### Core Infrastructure

- Monorepo setup with apps for web, mobile, and API
- Shared packages for tokens, UI components, and utilities
- Docker setup for development and production
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Web Application

- Basic routing with React Router
- Layout structure with navigation and footer
- Lazy-loaded pages for better performance
- React Query setup for data fetching
- Comprehensive theming system with light/dark mode support
- Theme toggle component with system preference detection

### Mobile Application

- React Native setup with navigation
- Basic screen structure
- TypeScript integration

### API

- FastAPI setup with basic endpoints
- Development environment with Docker

## What's Left to Build

### Theming System

- Fix TypeScript errors in React Router components
- Implement theming for mobile application
- Create shared UI components with theme support
- Add animations for theme transitions

### Web Application

- Complete page implementations
- Add authentication flow
- Implement data fetching from API
- Create form components with validation
- Add error handling and loading states
- Implement responsive design for mobile views

### Mobile Application

- Implement theming system matching web
- Create screen implementations
- Add authentication flow
- Implement data fetching from API
- Create native form components
- Add error handling and loading states

### API

- Complete endpoint implementations
- Add authentication and authorization
- Implement database models and migrations
- Add validation and error handling
- Create documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

### Shared Components

- Build UI component library
- Create form components
- Implement data visualization components
- Add animation utilities

## Current Status

We've made significant progress on the theming system for the web application. We've implemented:

1. A global CSS file with CSS variables for theme colors
2. A ThemeContext for React to manage theme state
3. A ThemeToggle component for switching between themes
4. Updated the Layout component to use theme variables
5. Modified the tailwind.config.js to use our theme CSS variables
6. Updated all web app pages (Home, Activities, Profile) to use semantic color classes (text-text-primary, text-text-secondary, text-text-tertiary) instead of specific color classes (text-gray-900, text-gray-500, etc.)
7. Implemented a new color system with a blue and gold palette that meets accessibility standards
8. Updated all CSS variables in global.css to use the new color values
9. Added text hierarchy variables (primary, secondary, tertiary) for consistent typography
10. Successfully set up and ran Docker containers for the entire application (web, API, and database)
11. Verified the theming system works correctly in both light and dark modes across all pages
12. Added button component classes in global.css for consistent styling
13. Updated all web pages to use theme-aware classes for proper dark mode support
14. Improved contrast in dark mode for better readability and accessibility

We've fixed TypeScript errors in the NotFound.tsx file by replacing React Router's Link components with regular anchor tags. Next, we'll focus on extending the theming system to the mobile application and creating shared UI components.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Theming Approach

- Initially considered using a CSS-in-JS solution
- Decided on CSS variables with Tailwind for better performance and developer experience
- Implemented a context-based theme provider for state management
- Chose semantic color naming for better maintainability
- Updated color system to use a blue and gold palette that avoids brand conflicts
- Implemented a text hierarchy system with primary, secondary, and tertiary text variables
- Ensured all color combinations meet WCAG AA accessibility standards

### Component Architecture

- Started with basic components without theming
- Evolved to use semantic color names for better theme support
- Implementing a more robust component system with proper theming
- Planning to create shared components between web and mobile
